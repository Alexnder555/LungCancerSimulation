# LungCancerSimulation
Generates a random DNA sequence, simulating the reproduction of cells by showing DNA replication and the mutations that could occur over 10 generations. 
Uses Random Methods to give a smoker a higher probability of mutations than a non smoker. 
If the total number of mutations is greater than 4 over 10 generations, the output will be, “you have lung cancer”. Otherwise, “you do not have lung cancer.”
